Let's assume this ends the game, and the agent loses.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine.  The agent wins the game, because all squares without mines are revealed.\n- The agent clears a square that did not contain a hidden mine, but has not yet won or lost the game.\n- The agent detonates a mine and loses the game.\n\nHow might you specify the reward for each of these four cases, so that by maximizing the cumulative reward, the agent will try to win the game?\n\nAfter you have decided on your answer, run the code cell below to get credit for completing this question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\n#q_2.solution()\nq_2.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-17T21:22:25.378711Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-17T21:22:25.379262Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-17T21:22:25.392286Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-17T21:22:25.379229Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-17T21:22:25.391666Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3) (Optional) Amend the code\n\nIn this next part of the exercise, you will amend the code from the tutorial to experiment with creating your own agents!
